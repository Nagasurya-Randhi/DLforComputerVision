## Intro
Instance segmentation can be thought of as a combination of object detection and semantic segmentation. 
In this project, an instance segmentation framework know as SOLO (Segmenting Object by LOcations) is implemented. In a similar manner to YOLO, SOLO produces mask predictions on a dense grid. This means that, unlike many other segmenation frameworks (e.g. Mask-RCNN), SOLO directly predicts the segmentation mask without proposing bounding box locations. 

SOLO has 2 branches - the category branch and the mask branch
